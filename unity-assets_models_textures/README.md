## Background Context
This project, one of a series dedicated to creating a prototype for a 3D ***[platformer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platformer)*** game, plays an integral role in preparing you for work on extensive projects and within vast 3D codebases in Unity. The real-world gaming environment often involves expanding codebases and unforeseen challenges requiring codebase refactoring to integrate new functionality. By focusing on developing a specific game architecture approach throughout this project, you will not only learn to maintain a clean codebase but also be better prepared to handle growth and evolution.

One of the key aspects you’ll learn in this project is interacting with Unity’s existing character controller components. To ensure a thorough understanding, you are barred from using free or paid assets from the Unity Asset Store or other sources for scripts. By emphasizing scripting, you gain the ability to create more flexible and optimized games.

Throughout your development process, remember to frequently test your game and create development builds. While speed is essential, prioritize completing each task thoroughly before moving on to the next.

The final product after the next few projects will function like this: [Platformer - Final](https://hs-hq.github.io/AR-VR/0x08-unity-audio/)

At the end of this Models and Textures project, we will be at this stage in development: [Platformer WIP - Assets: Models and Textures](https://hs-hq.github.io/AR-VR/0x05-unity_assets_models_textures/)

# ***Technical Description***
This project involves:

1. ***Prototyping a 3D platformer game:*** You’ll develop a prototype for a 3D platformer game using Unity. The final product will function as per this sample: Platformer - Final.
2. ***Building scripts:*** Without using free or paid assets, you’ll learn how to build scripts that interact with Unity’s existing character controller components.
3. ***Asset usage:*** You will gain hands-on experience with Unity primitives, learn what assets are in game development, how to import them, and understand the common asset types.
4. ***Development of 3D Models and Textures:*** Learn the essential elements of 3D modeling and texturing, alongside understanding how to use materials, textures, and skyboxes in Unity.
5. ***Game Physics:*** Understand the differences between Rigidbody and Character Controller, along with the pros and cons of using each.
6. ***Quaternion and Euler Angles:*** Get familiar with Quaternion and Euler Angles in Unity.
\
You are encouraged to test your game frequently and create development builds as you work through the tasks. Also, take your time to complete each task first and then go back to do a polishing pass when you have finished all of the tasks.
