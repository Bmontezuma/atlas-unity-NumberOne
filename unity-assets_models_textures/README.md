## Background Context
This project, one of a series dedicated to creating a prototype for a 3D ***[platformer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platformer)*** game, plays an integral role in preparing you for work on extensive projects and within vast 3D codebases in Unity. The real-world gaming environment often involves expanding codebases and unforeseen challenges requiring codebase refactoring to integrate new functionality. By focusing on developing a specific game architecture approach throughout this project, you will not only learn to maintain a clean codebase but also be better prepared to handle growth and evolution.

One of the key aspects you’ll learn in this project is interacting with Unity’s existing character controller components. To ensure a thorough understanding, you are barred from using free or paid assets from the Unity Asset Store or other sources for scripts. By emphasizing scripting, you gain the ability to create more flexible and optimized games.

Throughout your development process, remember to frequently test your game and create development builds. While speed is essential, prioritize completing each task thoroughly before moving on to the next.

The final product after the next few projects will function like this: [Platformer - Final](https://hs-hq.github.io/AR-VR/0x08-unity-audio/)

At the end of this Models and Textures project, we will be at this stage in development: [Platformer WIP - Assets: Models and Textures](https://hs-hq.github.io/AR-VR/0x05-unity_assets_models_textures/)
